<h1 align="center">Node.js Passport Auth</h1>

This project implements manual authentication, sign in/up through social accounts Google and Facebook.
The idea behind the client side (React) is to show the authentication process and how to handle small social window popups. In this project, I haven't shown how to handle the error messages in the UI, you can track it in the network or console tab.
